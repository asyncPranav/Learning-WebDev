            provides methods for date/time management.
        
            For instance, we can use it to store creation/modification times, to measure time, 
            or just to print out the current date.

            If we only want to measure time, we don’t need the Date object.

            create an intermediate Date object. So it’s faster and doesn’t put 
            pressure on garbage collection.

            It is used mostly for convenience or when performance matters, 
            like in games in JavaScript or other specialized applications.

            So this is probably better:

                - Optimize performance.
                - Compare two different algorithms.
                - Detect slow parts of code.


        */





        // ✅ Best Way to Benchmark: Date.now() or performance.now()

        // Example 2: Using performance.now() (⚡ Higher precision) - read it later

        start = performance.now(); // more accurate

        // 🔁 Task to benchmark
        for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            let cube = i ** 3;

        /*

            If we want a reliable benchmark of CPU-hungry function, we should be careful.

            For instance, let’s measure two functions that calculate the 
            difference between two dates: which one is faster?

            Such performance measurements are often called “benchmarks”.

            we have date1 and date2, which function faster returns their difference in ms?

            return date1.getTime() - date2.getTime();
        }


        /*

            These two do exactly the same thing, but one of them uses an 
            explicit date.getTime() to get the date in ms, and the other 
            one directly subtract date objects and relies on a date-to-number transform.
            javaScript automatically converts them to timestamps (milliseconds) for subtraction. 
            
            Both do the same thing, but in different ways but their resuls
            are always the same.

            So, which one is faster?

            The first idea may be to run them many times in a row and measure 
            the time difference. For our case, functions are very simple, 
            so we have to do it at least 100000 times.

            Let’s measure:

        */

        function bench(f) {
            let date1 = new Date(0); // 1 Jan 1970
            let date2 = new Date();  // Current date

            let start = Date.now(); // Start time

            for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
                f(date1, date2); // Call the function passed to bench 1,00,000 times
            }

            return Date.now() - start; // Return time taken
        }

        console.log( 'Time of diffSubtract: ' + bench(diffSubtract) + 'ms' );
        console.log( 'Time of diffGetTime: ' + bench(diffGetTime) + 'ms' );



        /*
            🧠 Why is getTime() usually faster? Because:

                -> date2 - date1 calls an internal method to convert objects to primitives → slower.
                -> getTime() directly returns a number (timestamp in milliseconds) → faster, less processing.
            
            Wow! Using getTime() is so much faster! That’s because there’s 
            no type conversion, it is much easier for engines to optimize.

            Okay, we have something. But that’s not a good benchmark yet.

            Imagine that at the time of running bench(diffSubtract) CPU was 
            doing something in parallel, and it was taking resources. And by 
            the time of running bench(diffGetTime) that work has finished.

            A pretty real scenario for a modern multi-process OS.

            As a result, the first benchmark will have less CPU resources than 
            the second. That may lead to wrong results.

            For more reliable benchmarking, the whole pack of benchmarks 
            should be re-run multiple times.

            For example, like this:

        */


        function diffSubtract(date1, date2) {
            return date2 - date1;
        }

        function diffGetTime(date1, date2) {
            return date2.getTime() - date1.getTime();
        }

        function bench(f) {
            let date1 = new Date(0);
            let date2 = new Date();

            let start = Date.now();
            for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) f(date1, date2);
            return Date.now() - start;
        }

        let time1 = 0;
        let time2 = 0;

        // run bench(diffSubtract) and bench(diffGetTime) each 10 times alternating
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            time1 += bench(diffSubtract);
            time2 += bench(diffGetTime);
        }

        console.log( 'Total time for diffSubtract: ' + time1 + ' ms');
        console.log( 'Total time for diffGetTime: ' + time2 + ' ms');


        /*
            Modern JavaScript engines like V8 (used in Chrome, Edge, Node.js) 
            use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation techniques. These engines 
            optimize "hot code" — code that runs many times — but skip or delay 
            optimizing rarely executed code.

            This means:
                - The first few times a function runs, it may be interpreted slowly.
                - After detecting frequent usage, the engine compiles it to optimized machine code.

            ✅ So what's the solution? Add a "warm-up" phase (aka heat-up run)
            
            This is how you improve benchmarking reliability by letting the engine optimize the code first:

        */

        // Improved Benchmark with Heat-up Run

        function diffSubtract(date1, date2) {
        return date2 - date1;
        }

        function diffGetTime(date1, date2) {
        return date2.getTime() - date1.getTime();
        }

        function bench(f) {
        let date1 = new Date(0);
        let date2 = new Date();

        let start = Date.now();
        for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) f(date1, date2);
        return Date.now() - start;
        }

        // 🔥 Warm-up run to allow JIT optimization
        bench(diffSubtract);
        bench(diffGetTime);

        // 🔁 Benchmark multiple times for accurate results
        time1 = 0;
        time2 = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        time1 += bench(diffSubtract);
        time2 += bench(diffGetTime);
        }

        console.log("Total time for diffSubtract: " + time1 + "ms");
        console.log("Total time for diffGetTime: " + time2 + "ms");
        console.log("\n");
        
        











        //---------------> Date.parse(str)

        /*
            ✅ Date.parse()

                Date.parse() is a built-in JavaScript method that converts a date 
                string into a timestamp (number of milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970, UTC).



            🧠 Syntax:

                Date.parse(dateString)
                    - It accepts a string in valid date format.
                    - Returns: Number (timestamp) in milliseconds.



            📅 ISO Date String Format (used in Date.parse() and new Date())

                The string format should be: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ, where:
                    YYYY-MM-DD – is the date: year-month-day.
                    The character "T" is used as the delimiter.
                    HH:mm:ss.sss – is the time: hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds(optional).
                    The optional 'Z' part denotes the time zone in the format +-hh:mm. A single letter Z would mean UTC+0.

                Shorter variants are also possible, like YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM or even YYYY.



            🧪 Notes:

                The call to Date.parse(str) parses the string in the given format 
                and returns the timestamp (number of milliseconds from 1 Jan 1970 UTC+0). 
                If the format is invalid, returns NaN.

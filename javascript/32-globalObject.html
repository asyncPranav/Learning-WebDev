            🌍 What is the Global Object?

                The global object is a special object that is available everywhere in your JavaScript code.
                It provides access to built-in functions, global variables, and environment-specific features.


            📌 Global Object Names (by Environment)

                | Environment                  | Global Object Name |
                | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
                | Browser                      |   window           |
                | Node.js                      |   global           |
                | Modern JS (all environments) |   globalThis       |



            💡 Why globalThis?

                To standardize the global object across all environments (browsers, Node.js, Deno, etc.), JavaScript introduced:
                globalThis : This works everywhere, unlike window or global, which are environment-specific.

        alert("Pranav");
        // is same as
        window.alert("Pranav");


        // In a browser, global functions and variables declared with var (not let/const!) become the property of the global object:
        var gVar = 5;
        alert(window.gVar); // 5 (became a property of the global object)

        /*
            Function declarations have the same effect (statements with function keyword in 
            the main code flow, not function expressions).

            Please don’t rely on that! This behavior exists for compatibility reasons. 
            Modern scripts use JavaScript modules where such a thing doesn’t happen.
        */


        // If we used let instead, such thing wouldn’t happen:
        let gLet = 5;
        alert(window.gLet); // undefined (doesn't become a property of the global object)


        
        // If a value is so important that you’d like to make it available globally, write it directly as a property:
        // make current user information global, to let all scripts access it
        window.currentUser = {
            name: "John"
        };

        // somewhere else in code
        alert(currentUser.name);  // John

        // or, if we have a local variable with the name "currentUser"
        // get it from window explicitly (safe!)
        alert(window.currentUser.name); // John





        //--------------> Using for polyfills

        /*
            We use the global object to test for support of modern language features.

            For instance, test if a built-in Promise object exists (it doesn’t in really old browsers):
        */

        if (!window.Promise) {
            alert("Your browser is really old!");
